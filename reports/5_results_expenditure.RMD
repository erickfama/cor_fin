# Data 

## ENCIG 2019

The following data was used to train the model. First, ENCIG 2019 survey results were used to classify municipalities into corrupt and not corrupt, the corruption section of the survey captures incidence of corruption within municipalitie by asking for any kind of involvement in a corruption act in the last five years. To determine the classification of corrupt and not corrupt municipalities, first we calculated the proportion of people who reported involvement in an act of corruption, then established a proportion threshold which, according to each municipalitie population proportion, determined if a municipalitie was corrupt or not. This resulted in 172 municipalities classified.

## EFIPEM 2019

The features we used were obtained from the EFIPEM 2019 data set which is an annual report of the public finances of each state and their municipalities. These data contains records of the public expenditure and revenue, and it follows a level structure where the higher level is theme and the lower level is generic heading. We used the generic heading (lowest level) as features for model training, which accounts for 246 total variables. Each of the variables were standardized by the total population of their respective municipalitie.

## Economic Census 2019

We also decided to add another set of variables to give more context to our model, because there are municipalities that are far different than others, i.e. municipalities from southern states as Oaxaca, Chiapas, Tabasco, in comparison with municipalities from northern states like Nuevo León, Baja California, Chihuahua. For that reason data from the economic census 2019 was added. First we selected relevant variables and categorized them by industrial sector according to 2018 North America's Industrial Classification System, which is divided into 20 main economic sectors. 187 is the total number of variables that were added from the economic census. We also added two variables from the Population Census 2020, which are total population of each municipalitie and average scholar level.
The complete data set contains more than 500 variables for the case of public expenditure.

# Model performance

The following table shows evaluation metrics for the trained model. Overall, model performance is good with an accuracy of 0.78 this performance was improved by adding data from the economic census (in comparison with previous models that we trained and didn't include those variables), and this improvement is better shown in the sensibility of the models which is their hability of correctly classify corrupt municipalities. In that sense, these model has a good predicting power to identify corrupt municipalities, and is reflected on the F1-score which value is 0.86. On the other hand, these model is not very good at detecting not corrupt municipalities according to the specificity value of 0.44, that is the reason for a lower balanced accuracy (0.67). However, in terms of public policy, it is prefer to have a good corrupt detection rate **[insert citation]** to ensure the right focus of regulations programs like audits.

```{r, desempeno, echo=FALSE}
sum_model <- function(model_cm, name){
  cm <- model_cm
  data.frame(Model = c(name),
             Accuracy = c(round(c(cm$overall["Accuracy"]), 2)),
             Sensitivity = c(round(c(cm$byClass[c("Sensitivity")]), 2)),
             Specificity = c(round(c(cm$byClass[c("Specificity")]), 2)),
             F1 = round(c(cm$byClass[c("F1")]), 2),
             `Balanced Accuracy` = round(c(cm$byClass[c("Balanced Accuracy")]), 2),
             row.names = NULL)
}

desemp <- sum_model(model_eg_inc$cm, "Expenditure - Incidence")

kable(desemp, 
      align = "c", 
      caption = "Table. Performance") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(position = "center", latex_options = c("scale_down", "HOLD_position"))
```

## Results

Gradient boosting (as others Tree based algorithms) has the feature of variable importance which is a score that indicates the relative contribution of each feature in predicting the outcome (Friedman et al., 2009). This score goes from 100 to 0, were 100 indicates the most important variable and 0 the less important variable. Table.x list the 20 most important variables.

```{r eg_inc_vars, echo=FALSE}
eg_inc_dicc <- read_csv(here::here("./data/3_final/eg_inc_dicc.csv"), locale = locale(encoding = "latin1"))

eg_inc_varimp <- model_eg_inc$var_imp$importance %>%
  add_rownames(var = "Variables") %>%
  rename("Importance" = "Overall")

# Loop para reemplazar los codigos de las variables con la descripcion del diccionario
for(i in seq(1, nrow(eg_inc_varimp))){
  if(eg_inc_varimp$Variables[i] %in% eg_inc_dicc$variables & !str_detect(eg_inc_varimp$Variables[i], "^partida_generica|^subpartida")){
    name_index <- which(eg_inc_dicc$variables %in% eg_inc_varimp$Variables[i])
    eg_inc_varimp$Variables[i] <- eg_inc_dicc$descripcion[name_index]
  } else {
    eg_inc_varimp$Variables[i] <- str_to_sentence(str_replace_all(eg_inc_varimp$Variables[i], "_", " "))
  }
}

kable(eg_inc_varimp %>% slice_head(n = 20), 
      align = "c",
      caption = "Variable importance. Expenditure") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(position = "center", latex_options = c("scale_down", "HOLD_position"))
```

As we can see, the most important variables that characterize corrupt municipalities correspond to financial assets related to payroll, financial services, and subsidies; Construction items are also relevant, which is not surprising according to the literature [**insert citation**], especially in articles related to the creation of infrastructure or the acquisition of materials.
