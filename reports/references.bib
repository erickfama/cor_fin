abstract = {In an era in which child protective service agencies face increased demands on their time and in an environment of stable or shrinking resources, great interest exists in improving risk assessment and decision support. In this article, we review the literature and provide a context for predictive risk modeling in the current risk assessment paradigm in child protective services. We describe how predictive analytics or predictive risk modeling using linked administrative data may provide a useful complement to current approaches. We argue that leveraging technology and using existing data to improve initial triage and assessment decisions will enable caseworkers to focus on what they do best: engaging families and providing needed services.}

abstract = {This paper shows how machine learning (ML) methods can be used to improve the effectiveness of public schemes and inform policy decisions. Focusing on a massive tax rebate scheme introduced in Italy in 2014, it shows that the effectiveness of the program would have significantly increased if the beneficiaries had been selected according to a transparent and easily interpretable ML algorithm. Then, some issues in estimating and using ML for the actual implementation of public policies, such as transparency and accountability, are critically discussed.}

 abstract = {Developing countries face a number of institutional problems in the process of revenue generation. One of the main problems is the corruption in tax administration. The second main problem of low revenue generation is the low quality of governance. This study analyses the effect of institutional and structural variables (corruption and governance) on tax revenues using a panel data set for 25 developing countries over the period 1990-2005. The GMM regression results show that corruption has an adverse effect on tax collection, while good governance contributes to better performance in tax collection. It is further observed that institutional variables have a significant effect on tax revenues.},
